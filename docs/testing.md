# Testing

## Build checks

```sh
make check-build-env
make
git diff --check
```

The build uses the target kernel tree, EtherLab `ecrt.h`, and exact matching
DKMS `Module.symvers`.

## Minimal acquisition probe

With IOD stopped:

```sh
sudo CW_EC_TEST_REPEAT=10 tools/cw_ec_test_master.sh
```

On 2026-07-24 this passed ten load/acquire/release/unload iterations. Master 0
remained available with 29 slaves and link up.

With IOD running, one probe load was rejected with `EBUSY`; IOD retained an
active Operation-phase master with 29 slaves and link up.

## Phase 2 discovery

With IOD stopped:

```sh
sudo tools/cw_ec_test_bus.sh
```

The script:

1. snapshots `ethercat slaves -v`;
2. loads `cw_ethercat.ko`;
3. runs malformed ABI and exclusive-open checks;
4. retrieves topology through `cw_ec_bus`;
5. closes and unloads the module;
6. confirms the CLI topology is unchanged;
7. compares position/vendor/product/revision for every slave.

Observed result on 2026-07-24:

```text
PASS: second control open returned Device or resource busy
PASS: unknown ioctl returned Inappropriate ioctl for device
PASS: short slave structure returned Invalid argument
PASS: wrong API major returned Protocol not supported
PASS: invalid slave position returned No such file or directory
PASS: setup add before begin returned Invalid argument
PASS: setup scalar length mismatch returned Invalid argument
PASS: duplicate setup sequence returned File exists
PASS: apply empty setup batch returned Invalid argument
PASS: zero-length SDO upload returned Invalid argument
PASS: zero-index SDO upload returned Invalid argument
PASS: 34 slave identities match; CLI topology unchanged
```

An additional 100 open/scan/close iterations completed, followed by 20
instrumented iterations that added no kernel warning/error. Master 0 was idle
and available afterward. This is lifecycle smoke testing, not kmemleak,
KASAN/KFENCE, or fault-injection evidence.

## Phase 3 commissioning SDO

Read-only upload:

```text
EtherLab CLI: 0x03
kernel UAPI:  03
```

for ED3L position 29 object `0x6060:00`.

The legacy recipe was applied to all five ED3Ls and every final mapping object
was verified. The legacy script ignored aborts from unnecessary zero-entry
writes. A cleaned strict 21-write recipe was then applied through the kernel
batch to position 29; all writes succeeded and final readback matched the
velocity PDO layout.

See `docs/ed3l-pdo-configuration-test.md` for exact values and remaining
persistent/declarative decision-gate tests.

## API 0.3 pending-configuration validation

On 2026-07-24, the API 0.3 module built against the target kernel/EtherLab
artifacts, loaded with IOD stopped, and passed the extended
`cw_ec_abi_test`. The new cases covered:

```text
PASS: config add before begin returned Invalid argument
PASS: duplicate config slave ID returned File exists
PASS: validate orphan config sync returned No such file or directory
PASS: valid config hierarchy accepted
PASS: config mutation after validation returned Invalid argument
```

The test used fictitious pending metadata only. It did not apply an EtherLab
slave configuration, activate the master, or write any slave. The module
unloaded cleanly and the subsequent five-minute kernel warning/error window was
empty.

The following no-activation construction test then passed:

```text
PASS: unsupported revision constraint returned Invalid argument
PASS: validated config hierarchy applied to EtherLab
PASS: duplicate config apply returned Invalid argument
PASS: config begin after apply returned Device or resource busy
```

The hierarchy addressed a deliberately absent fictitious slave. EtherLab
configuration objects were constructed and released on close, but the master
was not activated and no mailbox or process-data traffic was sent. Module
unload again left the recent kernel warning/error window empty.

The offline domain-registration extension then passed:

```text
PASS: domain created with one registered entry
PASS: stable entry ID resolved to domain offset
PASS: unknown entry ID returned No such file or directory
PASS: duplicate domain create returned Invalid argument
```

The first run exposed and then fixed an error-path bug where an unknown entry
ID retained the successful structure-header result. The full suite passed
after the fix. The deliberately absent slave allowed domain layout and cleanup
to be tested without activation or bus traffic; recent kernel warnings/errors
remained empty after unload.

## Phase 2 contention

On 2026-07-24, with IOD owning master 0, `cw_ethercat.ko` registered its device
without claiming the master. `cw_ec_bus` then failed to open the device with
`EBUSY` and reported that master 0 was already owned. After module unload, IOD
still held master 0 in active Operation phase with 29 slaves and link up.

This closes the Phase 2 contention check: registering the transport module does
not disturb the direct backend, and attempted control ownership fails cleanly.
